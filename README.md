# Executive Summary

### 1. Recruitment Growth and Peak Performance (2024):
In 2024, 12,266 candidates were screened, leading to 336 offers and 315 hires with a 2.57% conversion rate. The recruitment cycle was efficient with an average time to fill of 27 days and time to hire of 13 days. TopCV, CareerViet and Employee Referral were the primary high-performing sources

### 2. Declining Trend in 2025:
Although screened candidates increased by 18%, offers and hires dropped by 61% and 65% respectively. Conversion rate fell to 0.75%, indicating lower candidate quality or stricter selection. Time to fill increased to 31 days, hinting at bottlenecks

### 3. Source Insights and Efficiency:
TopCV, CareerViet and LinkedIn remained key sources, but offer conversion rates declined. Zalo and Employee Referral maintained high offer rates (>25%). Low conversion from Facebook, VNW and other boards suggests stricter source screening is needed

### 4. Candidate Quality & Funnel Efficiency:
A higher volume of screened candidates is now needed per hire, reflecting a drop in candidate quality or less effective screening. Causes may include broad but less precise sourcing, inconsistent evaluation criteria and process delays causing candidate dropouts. Recommendations include auditing top sources, tightening screening standards and reducing lead times to enhance funnel efficiency

### Key Takeaways and Recommendations:
Address causes of 2025 efficiency decline, including increased volume and process delays. Prioritize high-yield channels like referrals. Streamline interview and offer stages. Tailor sourcing strategies by business unit to balance volume and quality

## Insight Deep Dive
### 1. Source Effectiveness & Candidate Quality
- Overall data shows TopCV, CareerViet and Employee Referral generate most hires, but overall conversion to offer stays below 5%, indicating low sourcing efficiency
- A high number of screened candidates are required for each hire → suggests broad but low-quality sourcing or ineffective screening filters
- Sales 2024 mirrors the same pattern: high reliance on TopCV and Referral, while other online job boards deliver minimal offer rates
- Offer acceptance within Sales remains modest, pointing to potential candidate–role mismatch or less competitive offer terms
### Recommendation: Focus sourcing budget on proven high-conversion channels, refine screening criteria, and review offer attractiveness to improve Sales funnel efficiency

### 1.1 Recruitment Conversion & Process Efficiency by Business Unit (2024–2025)
- Overall trend: across 5 Business Units, overall recruitment conversion declined from ~18–27% (2024) to 6-21% (2025) in the interview to offer stage, showing a weaker funnel efficiency year-over-year
### Top performers:
- Coding for Kids and Children’s English Program maintained the highest conversion and stable offer acceptance (94–100%), reflecting consistent candidate quality and effective screening
- Adult English Education also performed steadily but saw a notable drop in early-stage conversion (from 21% → 6%)
### Areas to improve:
- Head Quarter and Management Services recorded the lowest interview to offer rates (8–12%) and longer processing durations, implying misalignment between requirements and sourcing quality
- Conversion gaps suggest potential inefficiency in initial screening or decision turnaround at these units

### 1.2 Time to Hire & Time to Fill (2024–2025)
- Average time to hire remained stable across BUs (13–17 days in 2024, 12–23 days in 2025), indicating consistent internal selection speed
- Average time to fill rose from 27 to 31 days overall, mainly due to Head Quarter (28 → 39 days) and Adult English Education (25 → 31 days), hinting sourcing or approval delays
- Management Services improved filling time (38 → 24 days) despite higher time-to-hire, showing process adjustments at sourcing or offer stages
### Recommendation: Reassess hiring coordination and approval timelines at BU level — Head Quarter may require workflow streamlining to align with operational BUs’ pace

### 1.3 Stage Duration Comparison
- Coding for Kids and Head Quarter experienced longer multi-interview durations (up to 9–14 days total), suggesting complex evaluation structures
- Management Services consistently shows extended final interview–offer gaps (≈9 days), pointing to internal approval bottlenecks
- Adult English Education and Children’s English Program keep the shortest total duration (5–8 days), indicating clear assessment criteria and decision efficiency
### Recommendation: Simplify late-stage evaluation flow (especially at Management Services and Head Quarter) and establish target turnaround benchmarks per stage

### Key Takeaways (BU-level Focus 2025)
Performance gap between education-related BUs (operational) and support BUs (corporate) widened. Recruitment efficiency is driven by clarity in role requirements, interviewer alignment, and sourcing focus. To improve overall efficiency:
- Calibrate interview and offer processes for Head Quarter & Management Services
- Continue leveraging strong-performing BUs (Coding for Kids, Children’s English Program) as internal process models
- Introduce BU-level SLAs on time-to-fill and stage completion to enforce consistency

## 2. Overall Recruiter Conversion Performance (All BUs combined)
### Overall insights:
- The team performs strongly in the final stages (Offer → Onboard), with most recruiters achieving >90–100%, indicating effective candidate engagement and offer management
- However, the main bottleneck lies in the early stage (Screen → Interview), which remains low (4–22%). This suggests issues in candidate quality or inconsistent screening standards among recruiters
- The Interview → Offer rate shows wide variation (7–32%), implying uneven assessment or closing skills across the team
### Recruiter highlights:
- Ms. A, Mr. S, and Ms. LH show consistently strong mid-to-late funnel performance, indicating solid interview and offer negotiation skills
- Mr. TP and Ms. L have the lowest screen-to-interview rates (4–8%), requiring improvement in sourcing or candidate shortlisting
- Team Leader maintains only 9% early conversion, but achieves 100% onboarding, reflecting effective post-offer management

### 2.1 Sales Recruitment 2024 → 2025 trend:
- Overall efficiency declined (total conversion 4% → 1%) despite a comparable number of screened candidates (~3.5K → 2.8K).
- Mr. S and Ms. A remain top performers (Interview → Offer at 36–44% in 2024, still 20–22% in 2025).
- The Screen → Interview stage dropped significantly in 2025 (mostly 5–17%), pointing to weaker candidate pipelines or stricter selection criteria.
### Key Insight: 
Sales funnel in 2025 shows tighter screening at the top, leading to a sharp drop in overall conversion. Review sourcing strategy or screening criteria to balance candidate quality and hiring volume

### 2.2 Academic Recruitment 2024 → 2025 trend:
- Slight decline in overall conversion (2% → 1%), but Offer → Onboard remains steady at ~100%
- Mr. S continues to excel (Interview → Offer 67% in 2024, maintaining 20–27% in 2025)
- Mr. C improved the most in Screen → Interview (8% → 33%), showing progress in candidate pre-screening quality
### Key Insight:
Academic recruitment maintains strong late-funnel efficiency but needs stronger top-funnel flow. Sharing best practices from Mr. C (screening) and Mr. S (interviewing) could raise overall conversion

### 2.3 Head Quarter Recruitment 2024 → 2025 trend:
- Conversion remained low (1–3%), though onboarding success is 100% with very few hires (18 hires from ~3,000 screened).
- Mr. TP stood out in 2024 with 100% full-funnel conversion, likely due to specialized role management.
- In 2025, most recruiters (Mr. C, Ms. L, Ms. LH) stayed at 1–2% conversion, and time-to-fill averaged 42 days, indicating procedural delay.
### Key Insight:
HQ recruitment involves niche roles with long approval processes. Reducing internal turnaround time or simplifying interview rounds could improve efficiency

## 3.Hiring Duration Across Recruiters: How Fast Does Each Recruiter Hire?
### Key observations:
- Ms. H and Ms. A delivered the highest hire volumes (87–108 hires) with efficient time-to-hire (11–16 days), proving strong pipeline ownership and quick turnaround.
- Team Leader showed extremely long stage durations (notably Apply → Screen: 37 days), leading to the highest Time-to-Fill (42 days) — indicating delays likely caused by role approvals or workload balancing.
- Mr. C and Mr. S achieved balanced results: moderate hire counts (39–51) and efficient process control (Time-to-Hire 12–13 days).
- Ms. LH consistently had the longest interview durations (13 days) and higher time-to-hire (23 days), suggesting slower decision cycles or coordination with hiring managers.

### 3.1 Yearly Comparison: 2024 vs 2025
### 2024:
- Balanced performance overall — most recruiters completed hires in 11–16 days, with average Time-to-Fill at 25–28 days
- Ms. H and Ms. A again led in volume (57–82 hires), with quick stage progression and short interview durations (5–8 days)

### 2025:
- Noticeable decline in total hires and prolonged cycle times, especially for Team Leader (TTF 48 days, TTH 39 days) and Ms. LH (32 days)
- Recruiters handled smaller volumes (max ~25 hires), likely reflecting reduced hiring demand or longer approvals
### Insight: 2025 hiring slowed down across the board. Efficiency dropped, particularly at the top of the funnel (Apply → Screen). Process bottlenecks appear more systemic than individual

### 3.2 Sales Recruitment (2024 vs 2025)
### 2024:
- Ms. H dominated (82 hires), showing high productivity and stable process (TTH 11 days)
- Mr. TP lagged behind with only 4 hires, possibly supporting niche or low-volume roles
- Overall, Sales had the shortest Time-to-Hire (11–16 days) among all BUs
### 2025:
- Volume dropped drastically (max 25 hires per recruiter)
- Team Leader again had an unusually long cycle (TTF 48 days, Interview Duration 41 days), affecting overall team efficiency
- Recruiters still kept TTH under 15 days, indicating internal coordination remained efficient despite fewer hires
### Insight: sales recruiters maintained good speed per candidate, but volume loss and management delays weakened overall productivity

### 3.3 Academic Recruitment (2024 vs 2025)
### 2024:
- Balanced and effective team — recruiters closed roles in 11–15 days (TTH) and 25–34 days (TTF)
- Ms. L achieved the highest volume (15 hires) with good turnaround
### 2025:
- Efficiency declined: time-to-hire increased to 20–27 days, especially for Ms. LH
- The interview duration spiked sharply for Mr. TP (59 days), possibly due to complex teaching role evaluations
### Insight: academic hiring faced major interview delays in 2025, signaling slow evaluation loops or panel scheduling issues. Training or better calendar alignment could improve pace

# Recommendations
- Refocus on source quality: narrow sourcing to high-performing channels (Referral, Zalo, TopCV) and phase out low-yield job boards to reduce wasted screening effort
- Strengthen early stage efficiency: the main bottleneck lies between Screen → Interview, standardize screening criteria and enhance recruiter–hiring manager calibration to improve conversion
- Optimize BU-level coordination: corporate BUs (Head Quarter, Finance) face long approval loops -> simplify hiring workflow and set BU-specific SLAs for faster turnaround
- Balance recruiter workload: a few recruiters handle the majority of hires while others remain underutilized, redistribute requisitions and monitor recruiter productivity monthly
- Accelerate interview to offer flow: Shorten interview duration and internal approval time to align with top-performing BUs (Sales, Academic)
- Reinforce data-driven management: track time-to-fill, time to hire and stage duration by recruiter & BU; use dashboards for coaching and accountability
- Sustain offer quality & employer brand: maintain the high offer → onboard success (90–100%) through continuous candidate engagement and clear expectation setting
