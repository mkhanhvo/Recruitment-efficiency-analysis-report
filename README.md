### Recommendation: 
Focus sourcing budget on proven high-conversion channels, refine screening criteria, and review offer attractiveness to improve Sales funnel efficiency

### 1.1 Recruitment Conversion & Process Efficiency by Business Unit (2024–2025)
- Overall trend: across Education Business Units, overall recruitment conversion declined from ~18–27% (2024) to 6-18% (2025) in the interview to offer stage, showing a weaker funnel efficiency year-over-year
### Top performers:
- Coding for Kids and Children’s English Program maintained the highest conversion and stable offer acceptance (94–100%), reflecting consistent candidate quality and effective screening
- Adult English Education also performed steadily but saw a notable drop in early-stage conversion (from 21% → 6%)
### Areas to improve:
- Head Quarter and Management Services recorded the lowest interview to offer rates (8–12%) and longer processing durations, implying misalignment between requirements and sourcing quality
- Conversion gaps suggest potential inefficiency in initial screening or decision turnaround at these units

### 1.2 Time to Hire & Time to Fill (2024–2025)
- Average time to hire remained stable across BUs (13–17 days in 2024, 12–23 days in 2025), indicating consistent internal selection speed
- Average time to fill rose from 27 to 31 days overall, mainly due to Head Quarter (28 → 39 days) and Adult English Education (25 → 31 days), hinting sourcing or approval delays
- Management Services improved filling time (38 → 24 days) despite higher time-to-hire, showing process adjustments at sourcing or offer stages
### Recommendation: Reassess hiring coordination and approval timelines at BU level — Head Quarter may require workflow streamlining to align with operational BUs’ pace

### 1.3 Stage Duration Comparison
- Coding for Kids and Head Quarter experienced longer multi-interview durations (up to 9–14 days total), suggesting complex evaluation structures
- Management Services consistently shows extended final interview–offer gaps (≈9 days), pointing to internal approval bottlenecks
- Adult English Education and Children’s English Program keep the shortest total duration (5–8 days), indicating clear assessment criteria and decision efficiency
### Recommendation: Simplify late-stage evaluation flow (especially at Management Services and Head Quarter) and establish target turnaround benchmarks per stage

### Key Takeaways (BU-level Focus 2025)
Performance gap between education-related BUs (operational) and support BUs (corporate) widened. Recruitment efficiency is driven by clarity in role requirements, interviewer alignment, and sourcing focus. To improve overall efficiency:
- Calibrate interview and offer processes for Head Quarter & Management Services
- Continue leveraging strong-performing BUs (Coding for Kids, Children’s English Program) as internal process models
- Introduce BU-level SLAs on time-to-fill and stage completion to enforce consistency

## 2. Overall Recruiter Conversion Performance
### Overall slowdown:
Across all recruiters's conversion rates, especially “Interview to Offer” dropped sharply from 2024 to 2025, while the Onboard rate stayed high (~100%). This suggests that once suitable candidates are found, they are successfully hired, but identifying them now takes more effort
### Efficiency decline:
- Average interview duration increased noticeably (up to 11–14 days, 41 days for Team Leader)
- Time to Hire and Time to Fill slightly increased, indicating a more complex process or lower candidate quality
- Recruiter performance gap widened: Mr. C remained the fastest recruiter, but the gap between top and low performers (e.g., Mr. C vs Ms. LH / Team Leader) widened in 2025
- Process bottleneck: The Screen to Interview stage continues to be the weakest link, showing challenges in sourcing candidates that meet interview criteria

### 2.1 Sales Recruitment 2024 → 2025 trend:
### 2024 Highlights: strong conversions across recruiters
- Screen to Interview: 12–20% (Team Leader: 43%)
- Interview to Offer: 30–44%
- Onboard: consistently 90–100%
- Most effective recruiters (Mr. S, Ms. LH) delivered short cycle times and high offer success.
### 2025 Shift:significant efficiency decline
- Screen to Interview fell to 3–15%
- Interview to Offer dropped to 0–25%
- Onboard remained high (71–100%)
- Only Ms. H and Ms. L maintained strong conversions, while others (Mr. C, Mr. TP) showed steep decreases, indicating stricter selection or poor candidate-job fit.
### Speed:
In 2025, Mr. C and Ms. H exhibited the shortest interview durations (4–5 days), while Team Leader took the longest (41 days). Despite slower processing, onboarding success stayed robust, highlighting issues primarily in early-stage screening.
### Insight:
Sales recruitment in 2025 saw slower, less effective early-stage conversions. Focus on improving sourcing quality and screening consistency to restore prior efficiency

### 2.2 Academic Recruitment 2024 → 2025 trend:
### 2024 Performance: balanced conversion rates
- Screen to Interview: 18–33%
- Interview to Offer: 9–75%
- Onboard: 75–100%
- Top performers included Mr. S, Ms. L, and Ms. H with steady results.
### 2025 Shift: marked early-stage decline:
- Screen to Interview dropped to 5–10% (except Mr. C at 61%)
- Interview to Offer mostly under 10%, only Ms. LH achieved 33%
- Onboard rates strong (81–100%), pointing to shortlisting as main bottleneck.
### Timing:
Interview duration increased moderately (8–14 days on average). Time to hire was stable (11–15 days) but Team Leader lagged at 39 days, suggesting slow approvals or delayed offers

# Recommendations
- Refocus on source quality: narrow sourcing to high-performing channels (Referral, Zalo, TopCV) and phase out low-yield job boards to reduce wasted screening effort
- Strengthen early stage efficiency: the main bottleneck lies between Screen → Interview, standardize screening criteria and enhance recruiter–hiring manager calibration to improve conversion
- Optimize BU-level coordination: corporate BUs (Head Quarter, Finance) face long approval loops -> simplify hiring workflow and set BU-specific SLAs for faster turnaround
- Balance recruiter workload: a few recruiters handle the majority of hires while others remain underutilized, redistribute requisitions and monitor recruiter productivity monthly
- Accelerate interview to offer flow: Shorten interview duration and internal approval time to align with top-performing BUs (Sales, Academic)
- Reinforce data-driven management: track time-to-fill, time to hire and stage duration by recruiter & BU; use dashboards for coaching and accountability
- Sustain offer quality & employer brand: maintain the high offer → onboard success (90–100%) through continuous candidate engagement and clear expectation setting
